1	Ambrosia artemisiifolia	Ambrosia artemisiifolia is a summer annual herbaceous plant that is native to temperate North America in the United States and Canada. Also commonly known as ragweed this forb establishes easily in human impacted and disturbed areas in high abundance. It is considered an invasive species in Europe, parts of Asia and Australia, although it is not an extremely competitively aggressive species and is mainly considered a noxious weed that interferes with other cultivated crops. The main impact of this plant is the copious amount of pollen produced from male flowers that are allergens to sensitive people, compounding health problems like rhinitis, oculorhinitis, asthma and causing skin irritations.;  (herb); Common Names: ambroisie à feuille d'armoise, ambroisie annuelle, ambroisie élevée, ambrosia aux feuilles d'armoise, ambrosia con foglie di atremisia, ambrosia de hojas de ajenjo, ambrozja bylicolistna, ambrozja bylicowata, annual ragweed, artemisia del pais, Aufrechte Ambrosie, Aufrechtes Traubenkraut, bastard wormwood, Beifußambrosie, Beifussblättriges Ambrosie, Beifussblättriges Traubenkraut, beiskambrosia, bitterweed, blackweed, bynke-ambrosie, carrot-weed, common ragweed, hay-fever weed, hog-weed, Hohes Traubenkraut, kietine ambrozija, low ragweed, malörstambrosia, marunatuoksukki, parlagfu, petite herbe à poux, pujulehine ambroosia, ragweed, roman bitterweed, Roman wormwood, römischer Wermut, Shinners ragweed, short ragweed, small ragweed, Stalin weed, stammerweed, stickweed, vadkender, vermellapu ambrozija, wild tansy; Synonyms: Ambrosia absynthifolia (Michx., 1803), Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. subsp. diversifolia (Piper, 1837), Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. var. jamaicensis (Griseb. 1861), Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. var. octocornis (Kuntze, 1891), Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. var. quadricornis (Kuntze, 1891), Ambrosia artemisiifolia var. artemisiifolia, Ambrosia artemisiifolia var. elatior (Descourt., 1821), Ambrosia artemisiifolia var. elatior f. villosa (Fernald & Griscom, 1935), Ambrosia artemisiifolia var. paniculata (Michx.), Ambrosia diversifolia (Piper), Ambrosia elata (Salisbury, 1796), Ambrosia elatior L., Ambrosia elatior L. var. heterophylla (Muhlenburg ex Willedenow, 1913), Ambrosia glandulosa (Scheele, 1849), Ambrosia heterophylla (Muhlenburg ex Willdenow, 1803), Ambrosia longistylus (Nuttall, 1840), Ambrosia media (Rydberg, 1910), Ambrosia monophylla (Rydberg, 1922), Ambrosia paniculata (Michaux, 1803, Ambrosia simplicifolia (Raeuschel, 1797), Iva monophylla (Walter, 1788)	lab_seq_inventory
2	Centaurea solstitialis	Centaurea solstitialis is a winter annual that can form dense impenetrable stands that displace desirable vegetation in natural areas, rangelands, and other places. It is best adapted to open grasslands with deep, well-drained soils and an annual precipitation range of 25 to 150cm per year. It is intolerant of shade. Although populations can occur at elevations as high as 2,400 m, most large infestations are found below 1,500 m. Human activities are the primary mechanisms for the long distance movement of C. solstitialis seed. The short, stiff, pappus bristles are covered with barbs that readily adhere to clothing, hair, and fur.  The movement of contaminated hay and uncertified seed are also important long distance transportation mechanisms. Wind disperses seeds over short distances.;  (herb); Common Names: geeldissel, golden star thistle, sonnwend-Flockenblume, St. Barnaby's thistle, yellow centaury, yellow cockspur, yellow star thistle; Synonyms: Leucantha solstitialis (L.) A.& D. Löve	lab_seq_inventory
3	Cirsium arvense	Cirsium arvense is an herbaceous perennial in the Aster family. It occurs in nearly every upland herbaceous community within its range, and is a particular threat in grassland communities and riparian habitats. C. arvense is shade intolerant and can tolerate soils with up to 2% salt content. It grows on all but waterlogged, poorly aerated soils, including clay, clay loam, silt loam, sandy loam, sandy clay, sand dunes, gravel, limestone, and chalk, but not peat. It spreads primarily by vegetative means, and secondarily by seed. The seeds spread as a contaminant in agricultural seeds in hay and in cattle and horse droppings and on farm machinery. It produces an abundance of bristly-plumed seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind and they may also be transported by water.;  (herb); Common Names: Californian thistle, Canada thistle, Canadian thistle, creeping thistle, field thistle, perennial thistle; Synonyms: Carduus arvensis (L.) Robson, Cirsium arvense var. argenteum (Vest) Fiori, Cirsium arvense var. horridum Wimmer & Grab., Cirsium arvense var. integrifolium Wimmer & Grab., Cirsium arvense var. mite Wimmer & Grab., Cirsium arvense var. vestitum Wimmer & Grab., Cirsium incanum (Gmel.)

4	Centaurea melitensis	Centaurea melitensis is a herb of the family Asteraceae.  C. melitensis is native to Africa and Europe and was introduced to the United States. It is a highly competitive species that forms dense, impenetrable stands that displaces native and desirable vegetation.  C. melitensis usually invades open, disturbed sites and is often spread by humans and livestock via transportation of contaminated crop seed or hay.;  (herb); Common Names: Abremanos, Croix de Malte, Maltese star thistle, Malteser Flockenblume, Napa thistle, tocalote	lab_seq_inventory
5	Centaurea diffusa	Centaurea diffusa is a 0.2-1.0m tall, biennial or short-lived perennial species, with a long tap root. The plant is well adapted for survival in disturbed, semiarid environments as typified by degraded rangeland and pasture, fallow land, neglected residential and industrial properties, gravel pits, clearcuts, river and ditch banks, and transportation rights-of-way. It appears to grow best on well-drained, light textured soils. It is not tolerant of flooding or shade. Seeds can be dispersed by manure transportation and when seed-laden plants become attached to the undercarriages of vehicles and equipment. Seeds can also be dispersed by wind, water, humans, and by wildlife foraging activity. Movement of contaminated forage and feed grains by livestock producers has also contributed to the weed’s widespread distribution.;  (herb); Common Names: chaber drobnoglówkowy, diffuse knapweed, sparrige Flockenblume, white knapweed; Synonyms: Acosta diffusa (Lam.)

20	Nymphoides peltata	Nymphoides peltata is usually introduced as an aquatic ornament though it is not the case in its native area. However, the sale and distribution of Nymphoides peltata is slowing becoming more controlled. It can become extremely invasive in shallow, slow-moving swamps, rivers, lakes and ponds. Currently there is little information available on the control of Nymphoides peltata but hand removal for small infestations and herbicides for larger infestations seem to be the most effective.;  (aquatic plant); Common Names: asaza, entire marshwort, floating heart, fringed water lily, xing cai, yellow floatingheart; Synonyms: Limnanthemum peltatum Gmel., Nymphoides nymphaeoides (L.)

41	Centaurea maculosa	Centaurea biebersteinii is a biennial or short-lived perennial composite and a very aggressive invader.  It has been reported to grow on a wide variety of habitats, especially industrial land, including gravel pits, stockpiles, power lines, grain elevators, railroad, equipment yards, pasture, range, and timbered range. It is often associated with irrigation, preferring areas of high available moisture. It appears best adapted to well-drained, light- to coarse-textured soils that receive summer rainfall.  Seeds may germinate over a wide range of soil depths, soil moisture content and temperatures. Dispersal is generally passive as seeds are shaken from drying capitula. Movement over greater distances requires transport by rodents, livestock, vehicles, or hay or commercial seed.;  (herb); Common Names: gefleckte Flockenblume, gewöhnliche Rispen-Flockenblume, spotted knapweed; Synonyms: Acosta maculosa auct. non Holub, Centaurea maculosa auct. non Lam.	cgp_ESTassembly
